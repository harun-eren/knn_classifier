##About the Project

This repository implements 3 tasks.

1. Implement a k-NN classifier in Python.
    * Develop a class with a function called "knn_classifier" 
    * The method inputs: train_features, class_labels, test_features, num_neighbors
    * Use of _numpy_ package for computing distances and locating neighbors
2. Make experiments with the Iris dataset.
    * Report train and test accuracy as a function of k.
    * Train-test ratio:67-33
3. Implement hyperparameter optimization with k-fold Cross Validation 
    * Report average accuracy across all settings to choose the optimum k value.

##### Additional Features
* Flexibility for alternative distance metrics and measurements
* Providing class probabilities
